# elk_ci

Filebeat is called "forwarder" , which forwards files from remote nodes
Elastic seracher is called "indexer"

And in between comes logstash

Very good Docker setup

Logstash:

Try:

1. logstash -e "input{stdin{}} output{stdout{}}"
   Now enter any text and logstash will add some more content like version etc and print to std output
   
2. logstash -f test.conf --config.test_and_exit 
    For testing if configuration is OK


Filters :

1. File based filter
  - CSV 
  - json
  - XML


2. Mutate Filter : it performs general mutations on fields. You can rename, remove, replace, and modify fields in your events.

3. Grok Filter:

use the pre-canned grok pattern for Apache

%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}


4. ID based filters
   - UUID : it generate a string thatâ€™s unique for every event, even if the same input is processed multiple times.
   - fingerprint: Create consistent hashes (fingerprints) of one or more fields and store the result in a new field. This can e.g. be used to create consistent document ids when inserting events into Elasticsearch, allowing events in Logstash to cause existing documents to be updated rather than new documents to be created.

5. Date : The date filter is used for parsing dates from fields, and then using that date or timestamp as the logstash's default timestamp for that event.However another add_field cand be added to use the timestamp for someother purpose.

6. GeoIP: The GeoIP filter adds information about the geographical location of IP addresses, based on data from the Maxmind GeoLite2 databases.

7. Drop : Drops everything that gets to this filter.This is best used in combination with conditionals, for example following will cause all events matching to be dropped.
```
    filter {
      if [loglevel] == "debug" {
        drop { }
      }
    }
```
8. prune : The prune filter is for removing fields from events based on whitelists or blacklist of field names or their values (names and values can also be regular expressions).
           NOTE: This filter currently only support operations on top-level fields, i.e. whitelisting and blacklisting of subfields based on name or value does not work.

5. Ruby: Execute ruby code.


Note : Common Options are supported by all filter plugins:
- add_field
- add_tag
- enable_metric
- id
- periodic_flush
- remove_field
- remove_tag
